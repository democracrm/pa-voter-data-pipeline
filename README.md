# pa-voter-data-pipeline
Data processing pipeline for PA SURE statewide voter registration data. The current focus is on preparing the data for
ingestion for other systems (such as SQL databases); further work to enrich the data is being considered once the initial
work is complete.

**NOTE**: You will have to [acquire the actual data yourself](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/PurchasePAFULLVoterExport.aspx);
state law prohibits its distribution (4 Pa. Code sections 183.13 (g) & 183.14 (k)).
